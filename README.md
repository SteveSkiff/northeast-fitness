## Key Elements
### - Structure and Organization
React and Styled-Components were two key pieces to building out this website. The goal in using these frameworks was to create a single page application with easily reusable components all in one package. 

### - Theming and Style
Branding for NorthEast Fitness aims at capturing a spirit of energry, while also remaining professional and clean. The targeted audience is middle-age professionals who have experience with fitness, but aren't necessarily athletes, with an appeal to both casual gym-goers and more serious lifters. 

### - Features
For NorthEast Fitness, it was important to offer prospects a way to easily browse the gyms information. Some key features that were important to the ultimate goal of converting prospects into members:
- A way to join or try the gym for free
- Available catalogue of classes offered with descriptions 
- A brief overview of the gym and it's focus for its members ('gym fit')
